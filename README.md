This is a donut formatted version of [this code](https://github.com/RandomThings23/donut/blob/main/donut.py). I did not make the alghorithm! (Nor did the programmer behind that code either, [here](https://www.a1k0n.net/2011/07/20/donut-math.html) is the original - in C)

It's pretty ugly and can definitly be improved, but not a lot. Python is limited!\
<sup>limited when it comes to formatting, that is. It's definitly not limited!</sup>

To achieve this i had to rename variables, put aliases for functions, bad optimisation, ugly as hell whitespace, long comments, `if 0:1;` and more *bullshit*.
